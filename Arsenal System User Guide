Introduction
Arsenal System is a weapon management system developed by Reverse-Alpha Studios.
This guide provides step-by-step information on the installation, usage, and basic functions of Arsenal System.

Installation
* Download Sample: Open your Unreal Engine project and download the Arsenal System plugin from the Marketplace.
* Inside the "ArsenalSystem" folder, right-click on the icon with the "ArsenalSystem.uproject" extension, 
  and then click on "Generate Visual Studio project files." After the program regenerates, 
  click on the same icon and confirm the prompt that appears. 
  After a while, your project will open once it has added and generated the "binary" folder.


Usage
* First, enter the blueprints of the weapons that are already categorized and divided by rarity levels within the project. 
  Inside, you can change the skeletal meshes to the desired skeletal meshes as you wish.

* If you want to change the pre-determined values of the weapons' properties, such as damage, range, durability, price, etc.,
  you need to access the code of the class to which the weapon is attached and make the changes there. 
  If you have any issues or questions regarding this, do not hesitate to contact us. We will get back to you as soon as possible and assist you.

* Currently, the system only includes two functionalities: equip and drop.
  If you want to add desired sound cues, you can enter the blueprint, type "sound" in the general search,
  and add the desired cues to the part that appears as changeable.

* Always remember that you can create, add, and remove new weapons at any time.
  You can make all these changes through C++. For this, we recommend first examining "Weapon.h".


Additional Notes:
* The weapon's data and access have been set up in two ways, and you can choose and continue or remove based on your game's preference. 
  These are: the capsule collision overlap system and raycast. 
  The code contains the necessary explanations for both. These will provide you with a simple and straightforward guide.

* With a simple and straightforward UI widget system, you will see and learn how to access and use all the information in the weapon's structure data in an explanatory manner.

* We are pleased to remind you that we will answer your questions within a maximum of 24 hours, so never hesitate to ask questions. 
  Lastly, we would like to remind you that this system is related to weapon classification and attribute assigment, and we may not be able to provide detailed assistance on more 
  advanced implementations such as your inventory system or different system like damage. These mentioned processes are very detailed and idfferent processes.
  For these, you may need to seek professional help.
